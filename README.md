At festember content, we write reports for 60-70 cultural events that take place during the four days of the fest. 
However most reports contain certain basic details in common. This project has been created with the objective of saving 
time in typing out these base details, as these sentences are the same and does not require a human to do repetitive work.
An Excel doc with just single words under each heading is the required input . And in this excel file we can have several
rows, each row for one event. This way we can prepare all our day reports at one shot with just a few words in an Excel doc.
This excel doc is to be save in the same folder as the program and after running the program the generated reports also appear
in the same folder. 

data.csv is a sample excel folder inserted to help users understand the expected format in which data is to be fed into the program.
